      <p>Reality check.
        
        How deserving we are has absolutely nothing to do with what we receive in life. We all know folks who 
        are the definition of decency and generosity yet are unable to succeed. In addition, we all know selfish 
        and slothful individuals who always manage to obtain what they want.</p>

      <br>

      <p>Life doesn't owe you anything, according to the first law of life. You must lead an honest and upbeat life if you want to receive what you deserve. 
        You must have a strong sense of deserving wonderful things. And you have to be ready to put in the effort for them.</p>

      <br>

      <p>Choosing what you deserve is the first step towards getting what you deserve. Think huge ideas without hesitation. Allow yourself to desire more from life. You only get one life. Tony encourages us to create masterpieces out of our lives as a result. What kind of life, in your opinion, is the most extraordinary? What will be your biggest regrets when you reflect on your life? 
        Your most notable achievements? These are your "musts," and achieving them will help you receive what you are due.</p>

      <br>

      <p>Do you believe you deserve a better connection yet you continually making the same errors? Consider yourself deserving of a raise or promotion, but have you never asked for one? Your self-limiting beliefs—that you are unworthy of love and that you are not intelligent enough to thrive at work—are preventing you from moving forward. You could be regretting a choice you made or feeling terrible over a prior error, but you must move on from the past. 
        You must genuinely feel that you deserve it in order to learn how to receive what you deserve.

        <div class="font-[Inconsolata] text-black px-5 opacity-[60%] text-sm lg:text-md mx-auto w-fit">
          “A Group of powertools in front of a red background”
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>This was my first prompt. But why this?</p>

      <br>

      <p>When it asked for a prompt, I went completely braindead. After a minute or two, i chose this random prompt;
        because I had a genuine interest in power tools, so it was the first thing that came to mind.</p>

      <br>

      <p>The texture may appear to be made of clay. The reason for this is that the machine's brain is unfamiliar with
        the material.
        When I ask you to imagine something like a drill in your mind, the image in your mind becomes extremely blurry
        when you focus on the details.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>In some cases, if the material is not clarified in the prompt, the result may be drawn in a completely random
        material. But when you do, it does not let you down:</p>

      <div class="my-10">
        <img class="blogimg"
          src="../util/blogpost/dalle-2022-09-13-095111-a-drawing-of-a-robot-hand-drawing-another-robots-hand.webp" />
        <div class="font-[Inconsolata] text-black px-5 opacity-[60%] text-sm lg:text-md mx-auto w-fit">
          “A drawing of a robot hand drawing another robot's hand”
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>I've heard many times that the given prompt should be described just they way it's going to look like. For
        example, asking for "An essential daily drink" would not
        be the best way to ask for an image, while you should explain "A blue bottle of water on a brown table,
        surrounded by nothing else, brick wall behind".
        This way, you ensure that the AI knows what you exactly want. Interesting, but it's not a problem for Dall-E
        even if you do not explain the looks of it.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>I've always wanted to give this AI a prompt that I personally couldn't imagine in my mind. I did, and it turned
        out to be one of my favorites:</p>

      <div class="my-10">
        <img class="blogimg"
          src="../util/blogpost/dalle-2022-09-13-100103-an-abstract-concept-of-freedom-in-style-of-oil-painting-467.webp" />
        <div class="font-[Inconsolata] text-black px-5 opacity-[60%] text-sm lg:text-md mx-auto w-fit">
          “an abstract concept of freedom, in style of oil painting | 467”
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Take a look. Isn't it a masterpiece? The brush strokes are simply too elegant for an artificial source to
        create.</p>

      <br>

      <p> Who would have thought, when the robot is asked
        for a concept of freedom, it brings up a bird with wide-spread wings, flying towards the horizon. It is a work
        of art; What a chad.</p>

      <br>

      <p>You might wonder, "whats that 467 doing in the prompt?". It is basically a verification method for Dall-E
        discord. their discord asks you to put a generated number
        in your next Dall-E promp. This is genius now, ain't it?
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>This might sound weird, but the "Freedom concept" really does give you some good results:</p>

      </div>

      <p>This "Freedom Concept" was not my idea. credit to <span

          onclick="window.open('https://www.codedojo.com/')">Seth Robinson</span>, he has some legendary prompts.</p>

      <br>

      <p>
        Next up, we have a dramatic landscape prompt, and yeah, Dall-E is good at landscapes, maybe a lot better than
        other individuals. (MJ, Gaugan, Etc.):
      </p>

      <div class="my-10">
        <img class="blogimg"

          “a beautiful sight of Mt fuji landscape, far sight, sakura trees, water”
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Sure, the city in the back is very indistinct and blurry, but Would you look at that! The color combination is
        just astonishing. i like how this image feels
        aesthetic and pinkish. Definitely gives me the vibes.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>This AI is like Axe in dota2. If you don't know how to work with it, you might say it's dumb and very weak. But
        when you actually take step into improving your prompts,
        you'd realize a major difference in the results:
      </p>

      <div class="my-10">
        <img class="blogimg"
          src="../util/blogpost/dalle-2022-09-13-104348-an-anime-girl-holding-a-flower-basket-sad-face-looking-straight-in-the-camera-the-background-is-made-of-small-green-numbers-in-a-grid.webp" />
        <div class="font-[Inconsolata] text-black px-5 opacity-[60%] text-sm lg:text-md mx-auto w-fit">
          “An anime girl holding a flower basket, sad face, looking straight in the camera, the background is made of
          small green numbers in a grid”
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>This image right here took me 5 credits to achieve, and now I am broke. Dall-E did not know what a matrix rain
        is, so it just gave me some rain in the background; it also didn't know what a matrix effect is, so i decided to
        omit the keyword "matrix" completely.</p>

      <br>

      <p>Although, it had some senses on what a number rain would look like:</p>

      <div class="my-10">
        <img class="blogimg"
          src="../util/blogpost/dalle-2022-09-13-105851-golden-gate-bridge-drawn-in-matrix-rain-numbers.webp" />
        <div class="font-[Inconsolata] text-black px-5 opacity-[60%] text-sm lg:text-md mx-auto w-fit">
          “Golden Gate bridge drawn in matrix rain numbers”
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Have you ever noticed how the numbers and words appear? Dall-E has yet to comprehend and master the art of
        drawing letters and numbers. When you ask for a word, it always gives you an indistinguishable word, and
        sometimes it generates a new language, doesn't care, and writes in mandalorian (As shown in the anime girl
        image).</p>

      <br>

      <p>Last but not least, I'm finishing this blog post with a bonus, and it's wholesome.</p>

      <div class="my-10">
        <img class="blogimg"
          src="../util/blogpost/dalle-2022-09-13-110911-a-closeup-of-two-ants-wearing-shades-they-are-each-busy-serving-breakfast.webp" />
        <div class="font-[Inconsolata] text-black px-5 opacity-[60%] text-sm lg:text-md mx-auto w-fit">
          “A closeup of two ants wearing shades, they are each busy serving breakfast”
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>These two ants are having the time of their lives. Or at least their imaginary lives. The prompt asks for
        shades, but i don't see any. This might be due to the fact that these small ants might even have shades smaller
        than bare eyes could see.</p>

        <br>

      <p>But i still wanted to see them wearing shades. What a party pooper. I might share my future Dall-E creations with you, if there were any. for now, Hasta la vista!</p>
